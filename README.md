# Restaurant Application


## My First NodeJs Project
Yes, this is my first NodeJs project. So while coding this project, I had the most difficulty in the learning part. Because I've never done a project with NodeJs before. That's why I spent more time on google than developing. I don't know how to separate service layer and controller. Also, do I need to create a different class for dto objects? Being a functional language gives you a lot of flexibility, but coding in more complex ways was also inevitable for me.

If I was coding in java, I would create an api-gw, and create separate microservices for both systems. But now coding for other system scares me a bit. Because I haven't been able to write the tests of the first system yet and I need to separate the layers and services to make it more readable.

## TODOS
Generally; add postman collection, dockerize services, improve documentation
### Booking manager :
- Tests
- Add documentation
- Clean the code and refactor
- Consider the layers

### Restaurant booking :
- develop the system according to requirements
- All of the above
